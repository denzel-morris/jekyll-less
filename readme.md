Less for Jekyll
===============

This gem provides a [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) converter for
[Less CSS](http://lesscss.org/) files.

Basic Setup
-----------
Install the gem:

    [sudo] gem install jekyll-less

In a plugin file within your Jekyll project's _plugins directory:

    # _plugins/my-plugin.rb
    require "jekyll-less"

Alternatively, add a configuration option in `_config.yml`:

    gems: ['jekyll-less']

Place .less files anywhere in your Jekyll project's directory.  These will be
converted to .css files with the same directory path and filename. For example,
if you create a Less file at _css/my-stuff/styles.less_, then the corresponding
css file would end up at _css/my-stuff/styles.css_.

Bundler Setup
-------------
Already using bundler to manage gems for your Jekyll project?  Then just add

    gem "jekyll-less"

to your gemfile and create the following plugin in your projects _plugins
directory.  I've called mine bundler.rb.  This will automatically require all
of the gems specified in your Gemfile.

    # _plugins/bundler.rb
    require "rubygems"
    require "bundler/setup"
    Bundler.require(:default)

Configuration
-------------
You can customize where Less `@import` statements load files from with `less_dir` (which defaults to `<source>/_less`).

If you want to load imported files from another directory, add the following to `_config.yml`:

    less:
        less_dir: _my_custom_less_dir/
